# Doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) - 2017

This is a JVM/Native crossproject.

To make this work you need to ...

* install git (`brew install git`)
* install sbt (`brew install sbt`)
* clone the repo (`git clone ...`)
* run the tests (`sbt aocJVM/test`)
* run the JVM main (`sbt aocJVM/run`)
* run the Native main (`sbt aocNative/run`)

Note: To [make Scala Native work](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/user/setup.html) you probably need to install a couple more packages.

Have fun!!!
