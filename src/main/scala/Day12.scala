/** Problem: [[https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/12]]
  *
  * Solution:
  *
  * General - A pipe is just an entry in a map that expresses
  * which program can communicate with which other program.
  *
  * Part1 - To find the number of programs that are connected
  * to program 0, we just walk the tree. We start with the root (0)
  * and visit all children until we have seen all nodes. When we hit
  * a node that we have already seen we can stop looking (because we
  * know, that we have hit a loop). At the end we just need to return
  * the number of nodes we collected while we traversed the tree.
  *
  * Part2 - To find the number of groups, we first take all nodes, then
  * we find all nodes that belong to group 0 (the group with the root 0).
  * Then we get rid of all nodes that are part of group 0, pick the first
  * node of the rest and build the next group. Then we diff the remaining
  * nodes with the ones that we just found group N. Until no nodes are
  * left over.
